        <div class="faq-question">
          How does paperback shipping work?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          As soon as you purchase a copy, we place an order with our printing partner, The Book Patch. They print the book (3-5 days) then ship to your address through USPS media mail (4-14 days) and charge us $1.93 handling + $3.81 shipping. These shipping and handling fees are included in the button price above. For example, How To Teach Your Child Chess is $18.95 for the book + $5.74 shipping and handling, for the total sale price of $24.69.

          We currently ship to the U.S. and Canada through our order system. Please contact us if you'd like a copy but need it shipped somewhere else! You may also purchase directly from the Book Patch bookstore, which has more shipping options.

        <div class="faq-question">
          Why not Amazon?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          We’re a small company, dedicated to our customers and authors. Amazon puts up a barrier between us and you while taking profits away from our authors (28.3% of revenue per book). We’ve decided to sacrifice a bit of convenience to enable a more humane, personal, and caring business. We’re excited to connect with you directly and proud to support our authors in creating great work! Thanks for your understanding and support, and do let us know your feedback if you need a book to be on Amazon.
